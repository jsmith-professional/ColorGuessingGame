# ColorGuessingGame
A simple color guessing game I made for an online tutorial.

This game was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. So far, it does not keep track of wins and does not have a game over functionality (if someone can't guess the right color until there is only one block left). I may come back and add it in later for practice.
